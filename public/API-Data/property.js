The Bill provides for land acquisition as well as rehabilitation and resettlement.  It replaces the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. 

The process for land acquisition involves a Social Impact Assessment survey, preliminary notification stating the intent for acquisition, a declaration of acquisition, and compensation to be given by a certain time.  All acquisitions require rehabilitation and resettlement to be provided to the people affected by the acquisition. 

Compensation for the owners of the acquired land shall be four times the market value in case of rural areas and twice in case of urban areas.

The provisions of this Bill shall not apply to acquisitions under 16 existing legislations including the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005, the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, the Railways Act, 1989, etc.

Do’s and Don’ts James adhikaram Land Consultant 9447464502.SVAMITVA, a Central Sector Scheme of Ministry of Panchayati Raj was nation-wide launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on National Panchayati Raj Day, 24th April 2021 after successful completion of pilot phase of scheme (2020-2021) in 9 states. Scheme is a reformative step towards establishment of clear ownership of property in rural inhabited (Abadi) areas, by mapping of land parcels using drone technology and providing ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners with issuance of legal ownership cards (Property cards/Title deeds) to the property owners. The Scheme is implemented with the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Revenue Department, State Panchayati Raj Department and Survey of India.  The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetisation of properties and enabling bank loan; reducing property related disputes; comprehensive village level planning, would be the stepping-stone towards achieving Gram Swaraj in true sense and making rural India Atmanirbhar.

     The scheme seeks to achieve the following objectives: –
     
     Creation of accurate land records for rural planning and reduce property related disputes.
     
     To bring financial stability to the citizens in rural India by enabling them to use their property as a financial asset for taking loans and other financial benefits.
     
     Determination of property tax, which would accrue to the GPs directly in States where it is devolved or else, add to the State exchequer.
     
     Creation of survey infrastructure and GIS maps that can be leveraged by any department for their use.
     
     To support in preparation of better-quality Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) by making use of GIS maps
